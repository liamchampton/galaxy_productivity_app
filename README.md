# Productivity App
This is an app that helps you acheieve your goals with llms and python. This app allows a user to input a goal and have an LLM generate a plan for how to achieve the goal..

## Deploy the application with the Azure Developer CLI
Using the Azure Developer CLI, you can deploy the app to Azure Container Instances. Follow these steps to deploy the app:

1) Clone this repository to your local machine.

2) Login to the Azure ising the Azd CLI

```bash
azd auth login
```

3) Create a gpt deployment in Azure OpenAI and choose a method to authenticate. This repositiry can handle 2 ways of authentication: 

- We recommend using (keyless authentication (via Entra Identity))[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity] to authenticate, as it is security best practice. The code in this project has already been written to enable keyless authentication, but you will need to set up permissions either via Azure CLI or in the Azure Portal for it to work. Read this [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/using-keyless-authentication-with-azure-openai/ba-p/4111521) for detailed steps on how to do so. 

- You may also authenticate using Azure OpenAI keys. Create you Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal and collect the necessary credentials (listed below). Once you have all of the credentials needed, create and add them to a `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=""
```

4) Deploy the application using the Azure Developer CLI

```bash
azd up
```

5) ‚è≥ Wait until the deployment has finished and navigate to the URL provided in the output to access the app.

## Running the app locally within a virtual environment
To run this Python app using a virtual environment (venv), follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository to your local machine.

2) Navigate to the directory where your project is located within your terminal.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3) Create a new virtual environment using the venv module. This will create a new directory named venv (or any name you choose) in your current directory.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

4) Activate the virtual environment. This changes your shell's environment variables so that running Python will get you this environment's Python and pip.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5) Install the necessary dependencies using pip. This will install the packages in the virtual environment, isolated from your global Python environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6) Create a gpt deployment in Azure OpenAI and get the API key. Once you have all of the credentials needed, create and add them to a `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=""
```

7) Run the app using the uvicorn server. This will start the server on port 8080, and you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

```bash
make run
```
